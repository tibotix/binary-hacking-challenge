# Preface

This repository contains the source code for our project in the "Fortgeschrittenenpraktikum: Binary Hacking" at Heidelberg University.
It contains a basic X86 Virtual Machine, a mini-kernel that can run inside this VM, and an exploit binary that builds upon the mini-kernel and exploits a vulnerability inside the VM to perform a VM Sandbox esacpe.
You can find the project poster under `/poster.pdf` and report under `/report.pdf`.
Further information can be found inside the subfolders.
